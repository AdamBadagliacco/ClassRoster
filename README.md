# ClassRoster

Web App in which a user can create teachers, students, and courses. Courses have one teacher and multiple students. 

Wanted to upload something of mine that displays my comfort with Sping and it's capabilities, so I picked this project. Thymeleaf is used in the front end. The list of students, teachers, and courses are all on an active database.
